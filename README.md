# Neighborhood Map Project

This is Project 7, and the final capstone project, of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program. Starter code was not provided.

The objective of the project is to build a one-page map application from scratch using Google Maps and React. The map is to display a minimum of 5 locations, as well as additional information about those locations that is received from another third-party API.

## How to Get Started

In order to view and use map application, you will need to install all the required depedencies and start the server.

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Dependencies Used

  This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

  Map was implemented using the Google Maps JavaScript API [Overview - Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial).

  Venues and venue data, including name and address, were pulled from the [FourSquare Places API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api).

  Fonts used are Major Mono Display, for the header, and Montserrat, for all other text. Fonts are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
